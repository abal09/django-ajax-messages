# Django AJAX Messages

**Auto-updating messages for Django.**

**Author:** Tom Christie, [Follow me on Twitter][twitter].

The `django-ajax-messages` package allows you to add auto-refreshing messages to your Django project.

## Installation

Install using pip:

    pip install django-ajax-messages

Add the following to your settings:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'ajaxmessages',
    )

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        'ajaxmessages.context_processors.ajaxmessages',
    )

## Adding messages to your templates

To include messages, add the following to any base template that
you want to display auto updating messages inside:

    {% include "ajaxmessages/messages.html" %}

There are also a number of javascript and stylesheet requirements that you'll want to include in you base template.  The only strict external requirement is jQuery, but you'll probably also want to include Bootstrap and FontAwesome to use the default style. 

#### Javascript requirements

You'll need to download and include jQuery, and include in the `ajaxmessages.js` static file that's included in this package.

If you're using the default template style, and want to allow users to dismiss alerts, you'll also want to include javascript for Bootstrap.

Place the following in your base template, just before the closing `</body>` tag.

    <script src="{% static 'js/jquery.js' %}"></script>
    <script src="{% static 'js/ajaxmessages.js' %}"></script>
    <script src="{% static 'js/bootstrap.js' %}"></script>

Download jQuery and Bootstrap and place the javascript files in your project's top level `static` folder:

     /static/js/bootstrap.js
     /static/js/jquery.js

#### Stylesheet requirements

If you're using the default template style, you'll want to include the Bootstrap CSS, as well as the fonts and styles for FontAwesome, that include the spinner icon used by the default style.

    <link href="{% static 'css/bootstrap.css' %}" rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
    <link href="{% static 'css/font-awesome.css' %}" rel="stylesheet">

Download Bootstrap and FontAwesome and place the stylesheets and fonts in your project's top level `static` folder:

    /static/css/bootstrap.js
    /static/css/font-awesome.css
    /static/font/FontAwesome.otf
    /static/font/fontawesome-webfont.eot
    /static/font/fontawesome-webfont.svg
    /static/font/fontawesome-webfont.ttf
    /static/font/fontawesome-webfont.woff
